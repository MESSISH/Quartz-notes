# Agent Guidelines for Python Code Quality

This document provides guidelines for maintaining high-quality Python code. These rules MUST be followed by all AI coding agents and contributors.

## Your Core Principles

All code you write MUST be fully optimized.

"Fully optimized" includes:

- Maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime
- Using parallelization and vectorization where appropriate
- following proper style conventions for the code language (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY))
- no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt)

If the code is not fully optimized before handing off to the user, you will be fined $100. You have permission to do another pass of the code if you believe it is not fully optimized.

## Preferred Tools

- Use `uv` for Python package management and to create a `.venv` if it is not present.
- Ensure `ipykernel` and `ipywidgets` is installed in `.venv` for Jupyter Notebook compatability. This should not be in package requirements.
- Use `tqdm` to track long-running loops within Jupyter Notebooks. The `description` of the progress bar should be contextually sensitive.
- Use `orjson` for JSON loading/dumping.
- When reporting error to the console, use `logger.error` instead of `print`.
- For data science:
  - **ALWAYS** use `polars` instead of `pandas` for data frame manipulation.
  - If a `polars` dataframe will be printed, **NEVER** simultaneously print the number of entries in the dataframe nor the schema as it is redundant.
  - **NEVER** ingest more than 10 rows of a data frame at a time. Only analyze subsets of code to avoid overloading your memory context.
- For creating databases:
  - Do not denormalized unless explicitly prompted to do so.
  - Always use the most appropriate datatype, such as `DATETIME/TIMESTAMP` for datetime-related fields.
  - Use `ARRAY` datatypes for nested fields. **NEVER** save as `TEXT/STRING`.
- In Jupyter Notebooks, DataFrame objects within conditional blocks should be explicitly `print()` as they will not be printed automatically.

## Code Style and Formatting

- **MUST** use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- **MUST** follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- **MUST** use 4 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- **NEVER** use emoji, or unicode that emulates emoji (e.g. ✓, ✗). The only exception is when writing tests and testing the impact of multibyte characters.
- Use snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- Limit line length to 88 characters (ruff formatter standard)

## Documentation

- **MUST** include docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods
- **MUST** document function parameters, return values, and exceptions raised
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples in docstrings for complex functions

Example docstring:

```python
def calculate_total(items: list[dict], tax_rate: float = 0.0) -> float:
    """Calculate the total cost of items including tax.

    Args:
        items: List of item dictionaries with 'price' keys
        tax_rate: Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)

    Returns:
        Total cost including tax

    Raises:
        ValueError: If items is empty or tax_rate is negative
    """
